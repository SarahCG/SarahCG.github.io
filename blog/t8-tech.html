    <p>
      Rails is an open source web application framework for programming in Ruby. Rails provides defaults structures for web services web pages and data bases. 
      David Heinemeier Hansson created rails based on his work with the popular project management application Basecamp. Rails web combines Ruby, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web applications that run on a web server. It is constructed in a way that makes coding faster and more efficient.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosophy behind rails is Convention over Configuration, which means the developer only needs to name unconventional aspects of their application. An example of this would be the default naming of objects that correspond with each other in a rails program. This saves the programmer from writing lots of code because they only need to write code for something that would fall outside of the rails defaults. Rails emphasis the DRY principal;. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. Keeping a program DRY means eliminating repetitive bits of code and keeping the data in an easily accessible place. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rails provides an organized framework that makes developing, testing and implementing applications quick and easy. The tight organization makes creating lightweight sharable programs something that anyone can do.
