      Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience? 
My take on the DBC experience is that it will be unapologetically intense but rewarding. It is essential that you come into this with an open mind. Everyone has their own skills and weaknesses, but the DBC team strives to provide every bit of support they can. It is up to you to stay honest about your work and your mindset and not close yourself off from the full experience.

        What is your impression of DBC? 
DBB culture seems to be constantly and quickly evolving and they are devoted to making sure you are not just reciting lessons, but really pushing your limits and learning. They also have a wonderful approach to learning about yourself and how you interact with others. It is rare to find a program that aims to balance both hard skill and soft skills.

        How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
I am still feeling things out, but exited to see what comes next. I still think that I might be in over my head, but that is why I am here, I know where I need work.

        Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?
My expectations of DBC have changed in a few ways. It's moving a lot faster than I would have expected, but in turn, I have learned so much this week it’s incredible. I am still figuring how to do certain things and what certain terms mean, but I am sure it will become routine in time.

        Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?
I am excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. I feel like this is going to be a bumpy ride at times, but there's a system to keep you from flying off the rails.

       Does it make you nervous?
Yes. I know that there is support at every corner, and we’re all on the same boat, but the nerves may never go away. I am still a little confused, make silly mistakes and get worried I am about to muck up something that I won’t be able to fix, but I am definitely gaining more confidence and it’s getting easier every day.
