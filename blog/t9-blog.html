      Maintaining a blog has been an interesting process for me. I like writing, and talking. It can be hard to get me to stop talking when I am excited about something. I will keep going even if I'm pretty sure no one is listening. Here's the weird thing... I can't think of anything to blog about.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Paragraph 2-->
      Sure I know that HTML can be trickier than you expect, and CSS can be a bottomless rabbit hole. EVERYONE knows that. What I had the most trouble with was coming up with something write each week. Even when we had the topics laid out for us. That may mean I am a perfectionist. I don't know for sure. 

    </p>
    <p>
      At the very least I can take solace in the fact that I am blogging honestly. Even if it has at times felt like more of a chore than a conversation. I think it may come easier the more I have time to write, not while I am trying to tie up all the loose ends and submit my course work for the week (which admittedly makes me a stress-ball). 
    </p>  
    <p>
     Is there one bit of advise I would have wanted to tell my past self while setting up the HTML/CSS for the site and my blog? <br> <br>

     Make sure the links work. All of them. Double check so you don't have to go back and revamp everything just because of a minor change. You will thank me for this warning. 

     <br><br>

     Oh if I could have known that then. Signing off. Happy blogging to you!
