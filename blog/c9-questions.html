      <!-- Analyze some of the questions you've asked (either in the community, to a a friend, or in Google). Were these good questions? What was good/ not so good about them? How could you make them better so you are more likely to get an answer? --> I have had countless questions during phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. Most times the answer was a simple google search away, but when it comes to something challenge specific, I did push out of my shy little bubble and post a question on our Google + community.

      <!-- Paragraph 2-->
      Here it is in all of it's glory -  <br>
       If anyone has completed the variable scope challenge, do you have any suggestions for old code challenges to refactor?ï»¿<br><br>
       Oof. That's not a great question, Sarah. Kudos for being brave enough to ask, but let's see what we can do to improve it. 

    </p>
    <p>
      <!-- Paragraph 3 -->      
      There are a few things about this question that we could improve. 
      <ul>
        <li>Be specific</li>
        <p>What answer are you looking for? <br> Part of the challenge was to find and refactor older code using our newly developed understanding of class and variable scope. I had trouble finding any older code to work on, because up to that point our code challenges were pretty simple and our variables were mostly local.<br> A better question would have given a more specific understanding of why I was struggling to find an old code challenge that would be appropriate to refactor. As it is, the question is pretty vague. 
        </p>
        <li>Be clear and concise</li>
        <p>This question is pretty wishy washy and open ended. Even if people had examples of old code they chose to refactor, it may not be helpful seeing that everyone codes differently. It would be helpful to have given an example of what I tried and why it was not producing the results I wanted.</p>  
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    Refactored Question: <br> <br>
    Variable Scope Challenge - <br>
    Having trouble finding previous code challenges to refactor since we've been working with local variables up to this point. <br>
    Can anyone suggest an old challenge they were able to refactor? 
    </p>  
    <p>
    This is much more descriptive, and clearer in what it is actually asking.
    Admittedly this is a skill that I need to work on. The only bad questions are the ones that go unasked. </p>
