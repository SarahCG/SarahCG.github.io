  <section>  
    <p>
      This week we are reflecting on our phase 0 journey so far, and thinking about how our thinking styles and mindset effect our experience. 

    </p>
    <p>
        My Gregroc thinking style is Abstract Random. </p>
      
        <p>What I like- Listening to others, bringing harmony to group situations, establishing healthy relationships, focusing on the issues at hand</p>
        <p>Things I have trouble with - Having to explain or justify feelings, competition, concentrating on one thing at a time, giving exact details. This list could go on, but these are what I have seen in myself the most</p>
  
  <p> My biggest struggle in this phase of Dev boot camp has been concentrating on one thing at a time. I find myself drifting away from things I am working on because I am always running through a mental list of what else is going on. A few examples: Am I taking too long to get this? What if I go back and fix that? Oh no, what if my Internet goes out and I have to run and find a network connection - I should plan for that. Double check you set your timer. It can take a lot of energy to keep up with my thoughts.
</p>
    <p>
      Is this related to my learning style? Yes. It appears so. It's strange that you can like focusing on the task at hand, but have trouble concentrating on one thing at a time. This is a conflict that most (beautiful and talented) Abstract Randoms share.  
    </p>
    <p>
      What am I going to do about it? Tough question. Here's the advice I want calm me to tell stressed me. 
      <ul> 
        <li>Remember this is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Don't burn out on little things.</li>
        <li>STICK WITH YOUR TIMER! JUST DO IT. It may be tough now, but I am building a habit.</li>
        <li>Let things go when they aren't perfect. You can always go back.</li> 
        <li>Be in the moment, try not to let it slip away. 10 minutes ago is gone and two days from now hasn't even happened yet</li>
      </ul>

    </p>
    I feel like I am back and forth between fixed and growth mindset. Part of me wants to hold on to getting something just right and not letting others see me sweat. It's comfortable but it won't get you very far. When I step back and look at the past three weeks, I realize how much I have grown. I had unconsciously set so many restrictions for myself that seemed like huge obstacles and I blew them to pieces out of necessity. It is tough, but I am getting somewhere.
