  	<!-- #### Option 1. OO vs. Functional Programming
So you've had some experience with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) this week. Some consider Functional programming the opposite of OO - compare them. -->
    <p>
        <!-- Functional -->
        Functional programming in Ruby places the emphasis on functions, functions, and more functions. 
        You break down a large program into little pieces and create your structure using higher functions that contain data that other functions can accept and then  return new data. All of the functions are public, which is why they can chain together in this way. This can lead to a bit of a sticky problem if you need make changes to your program. Since all of the functions are connected, you have to be very mindful of how the changes will effect each of the other functions that are connected to it. This is not to say that it is impossible to change the behavior of your functions, there are just more steps you need to take to make those changes. 

    </p>

    <p>
    <!-- OOP -->
    Object oriented in Ruby places the emphasis on objects. You create your structure with classes that contain functions that hold your data, but you can manipulate all of the data in a given class. This makes it easier to make changes to your code. When you can change the behavior of an entire class you can choose whether or not those changes will effect any of the other subsequent classes you have created. In the Object Oriented model you can choose whether your data is public or private, this helps keep the program flexible because you can still build upon complex programs, but keep private data that only the class this data is in can access. This makes sense if you are building a program that has a lot of data that you do not need to grant users access to. 
    </p>
    

    <p>
     Some people say that functional programming and object oriented programming are opposites. I am still learning about each, but at this point I disagree. I see how each practice has it's pros and cons. They seem similar to me in how the data is contained, but OOP seems much easier build for the future, and allow others to change your code whenever needed. I like that approach, but will need more practice to understand how to best implement it.
