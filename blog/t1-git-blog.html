      Let's talk about version control. Ready? Cool.
Version control is a system for tracking all of the changes made to files and directories within a repository. Version control is especially helpful if you have a project that you are you are constantly editing and updating, or if you are working with a team of collaborators on a file and each of you have your own piece to contribute to the same working file.  
Let’s break it down.

        The repository is the collection of files and directories that you want to have version control over. It hosts the most recent version of the files, but also has all of the historical versions so that you can access at any time.
        It acts as a log of the evolution of the files and directories that is holds. 
        It keeps track of every change. 
        - what it was  
        - who made it
        - when was it made

The best part is the directory does this automatically. There is no way to change anything in the repository without documenting it.

        Git is a version control tool that programmers use. It's a program that you download and write with, just like any other application on your computer. The easiest way to describe how git tracks changes to a file is to compare it to tree. In git you can take a master file, which we'll think of as the trunk, and create a branch off of that trunk file, and work from branch without effecting the trunk. Branches are where you can go nuts! Test things out, see what works, make as many branches as you want, it won’t affect the trunk one bit. Once you have the branch that you like, you merge it back into the tree (the master file) and bingo! Master file updated, and and git records that merge.

       Git hub is a website that you can post repositories on (remember them?). It's a little bit like drop-box, you can access your repositories from anywhere and choose whether they are public or private.

        GitHub is great, and here's why:
        -Its free. Who doesn't like that? You can uprgade if you want to get a little fancier or want more room for repositories. 
        - It's social 
        If you post a code to a public directory anyone can view it and submit changes that could improve it. The best part here is that you can control whether you choose to accept those changes or not. 
        - It's great for large teams
        Since the repository holds the most current files everyone will be on the same page. 
        - It's HUGE
        Take a minute and google the top projects on GitHub. You'll see everything from jQuery to Bootstrap. It's hard not to go down a rabbit hole exploring projects on GitHub.
        - It's simple (with a little practice) 
        Want to add a repository or update a file? GitHub lays it all out for you and keeps track of all of your changes.
