        <!--In your post, discuss what stereotype threat is and consider whether you can identify times when you have been impacted by it. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your own personal experiences, try to think of situations that may trigger stereotype threat outside of the examples you researched.

Consider how affected your achievement or how it could impact someone else's achievement (if you are not sharing personal experiences)?

If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to? If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?

Go into as much depth as feels comfortable for you. Again, if you're not comfortable sharing your own experiences, please apply what you've learned by coming up with some situations where others might feel it.

If you would prefer to answer different questions entirely, please feel free to do so within the context of stereotype threat. -->

       Stereotype threat is the threat of internalizing and accepting as an individual the negative stereotypes of a group in which you belong. Internalizing and applying these negative stereotypes to one's self can lead to handicapped performance on tasks in which there are negative stereotypes assigned to whichever group that your belong. Some examples of this are women being associated with poor performance in mathematics or driving, but these stereotypes can go the opposite way as well, such as the expectation that Asian males have superior math skills. <br>
    Once you are aware that there is a negative stereotype associated with any given task, it can lead to stress while performing said task, and lowered expectations of your own performance. You may even avoid the task all together, because of your perception of your own limitations can lead you to feel as if you will fail no matter how much effort you put into it.

      When I reflect upon my own experiences with stereotype threat as a woman I can see some situations that I have limited myself, even unconsciously. <br>
      It makes me feel a bit strange to address this, the pit in my stomach even discussing it is just as strong as when I became aware that it was happening to me. Most of my career so far has been very service oriented. I've been an assistant, receptionist, waitress, you name it. I like helping people, so it's a natural fit. <br>
      I had vague rumblings of disappointment when I began to feel as if in some situations women are expected to handle the office "house keeping". Now, I know that this was entirely reasonable to expect in some of my past jobs. So I am going to try to stay as broad as possible. I have seen times when it is assumed women will take notes during meetings which can limit how much they can contribute. Taking time away from work to help new employees understand procedure, even though training or reference material has been provided because you feel the need to nurture your group. And sometimes just the vague expectation that women will handle the set up and clean up details for events, or keep track of birthdays or the pool for office gifts.

    I think that this can be aided by speaking up and questioning situations when you feel that people are acting on a stereotype. They may not even recognize that they are even buying into stereotypes that are deeply ingrained. Once you bring it to the surface and ask people to examine their perception of certain situations it can dramatically shift their thinking. Sometimes it can be difficult to identify, and scary to bring to light. Group think can be a daunting thing to challenge as an individual. Once you have spoken you then need to observe the result. Sometimes speaking up can change the situation, but if your opinion gets swept under the rug or even worse, has a negative impact on your environment, you have to be ready to judge whether you are in the right environment and prepared to move on if not.
