    <p>
    Conflict is a part of life. When your values and opinions clash with others it can cause some pretty complicated and sour feelings. Conflicts can be big or small. It's difficult to think of a time that I had a conflict that sounds super serious, but the best example I can come up with was when I was younger and working my way up the totem pole in a customer service position. My workplace was open during the holidays and it would always be a delicate issue as to which of us would be able to take which holiday off. As much as I wanted to work my fair share of holidays, there were always some who wanted all of them off. I was caught between feeling guilty for taking my time off, and upset because the time off should be evenly distributed.   
    </p>
    <p>
    We were able to choose one holiday not to work, after choosing mine I made my travel plans and set up time to visit my family. It became somewhat irritating to hear coworkers complaining about having to work through the holidays and asking if there was any way I could cover their shifts. I was upset because it felt like, hey, we are all on the same boat here we're all working through holidays too. It's a bit unfair to guilt people out of their time. These requests and complaints happened pretty frequently.    
    </p>
    <p>
    I realized that saying no to requests that I work during the time I had specifically asked to have for myself and my family wasn't going to be the end of the world, and was able to stay strong in my answer. I realize that whoever was asking may not even realize that they were making asking such a huge favor. They didn't know I was traveling, or when I last saw my family. They were simply asking if I could cover, which unfortunately I could not. They could always ask someone else. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned that sometimes you have to step outside of your head and not assign other people's motives. Once I was able to let go of whatever upset or guilt I had built around not compromising, the issue seemed to become so much smaller than I was thinking.
