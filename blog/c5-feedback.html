## Release 2: Write your Blog!

### Discuss (at least) the following in your blog post:
#### Pairing:
- What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?
- Was something particularly fun or rewarding?
- Was something frustrating and difficult for you?

#### Feedback
- How did you feel when you read your feedback?
- Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?
- Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to
do to improve next time you pair?
- How was it to write feedback?
- What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?

Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?--> 
    <p>
      Pairing at DBC is when you work with other people in your group on challenges in the curriculum. <br>

      Once you have finished your session you provide feedback for your pair. DBC wants your feedback to be specific, constructive and kind. The first week we had required pairing challenges that required us to give feedback I was terrified.
      <br>
      This has changed dramatically.

      Before we jump in I have a confession - 
      <br>
      I am painfully shy. 
      <br>
      Being shy can limit you in many ways. It is much more comfortable to be a wall flower. As long as you don't say anything, no one will challenge you. I get this, but that is the worst part of being shy. You know you are closing off and you know it is something that you don't want to do. 
      <br>
      I have to admit, at first pairing and was really daunting to me. The thought of meeting new people, and then telling them how it went and what could be better was stressful. The first week we had required pairing challenges I couldn't stop playing through worst case scenarios in my head. What if my Internet cuts out? What if I slow them down? What if ultimately we don't like each other and can't figure out how to work together?
      <br>
      Thankfully none of this happened. I met more awesome people than I ever would have on my own. Some were as nervous as me, some were confident and playful, not once did I have a bad experience. We're all in the same boat, and it was great to compare notes. There is so much you can take away from a pairing session. Your partner may have a solution when you are stuck on something. They may inspire you to stick it out when you want to give up and throw your hands in the air. Sometimes your pair could be just as confused as you are and when you can both be honest about that, it takes a ton of stress out of the situation. 
      <br>
      Sharing the victory of coming to a solution as a team is one of the most rewarding feelings in the world, but even if you can't figure something out, you form a bond. Would I have said this 5 weeks ago? Maybe. Would I have believed it? Nope. This experience is melting the shyness away. 
     </p>
     <p>
     Giving feedback can feel like a tough task. It's good to keep in mind that you are not judging the other person, merely telling them what your side of the experience was like. It may be hard to vocalize during your session, but after a while it becomes easy to put words to your thoughts. I learned to just be honest, kind and don't over-think it. It's easy to spend a ton of time thinking of how best to word feedback and edit it until it's a bunch of mush that won't help the other person. 
     <br>
     Receiving feedback is the same. Don't over-think how your session went, wait to hear from them. I stewed for days thinking every piece of feedback would expose my greatest weaknesses and make me feel like an awkward social reject. I was surprised that each piece of feedback I received was incredibly positive and I even helped people! This was a relief, but also such a boost to my esteem. It definitely makes me feel like part of the team. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Overall, I think that both pairing and giving and receiving feedback has pushed me out of my comfort zone, and that is an amazing thing. I have gained a sense of confidence that has spilled over into my non-programming life and helped me snap out of the shyness trap when I feel myself sinking into it.
