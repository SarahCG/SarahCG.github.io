      <!-- Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you.
-->  Helping others has always been important to me, ever since I was a child. If I see you need something that I can help you with, I can't fight the urge to do that. I do have trouble when that instinct takes control of me. I will go out of the way to give random people the world, whithout looking at the bigger picture. It's easy to forget to take care of yourself when helping others makes you feel affirmed in who you are. As with all things it is a process of seeing where you get stuck, and trying to remember that instance the next time you are in that situation and work against whatever beliefs lead you to trouble the last time.

        <!-- What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important? -->
      The last time someone asked me for adivce it totally related to the values I find important. The topic of this is something I wish to keep between me and them. In all honesty, not many people need to ask for my advice. I will spout my suggestion to anyone who seems to be grappeling with something and that isn't always welcome.
      <br> 
      I don't want to go into detial, but I hope that I was able to give advice if that is what they wanted or provide a soundboard if that is what they needed. I struggle sometimes with how best to help people, even though that is the top level on my list of values.

       <!-- How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?-->
       I am comfortable with my values. Who wouldn't be? If you begin to question your values I think it's best to step back an examine where you are in life and understand why your values have changed. Many people feel as if their values are fixed and will never change, but changing your mind is human. It's the coolest thing we can do! If I looked at my values now, compaired to 10 years ago they might be completely different, but that was me 10 years ago. Staying fluid keeps me afloat. I do feel like stereotype threat is out there and it's strong and stealthy. As long as we see echother for who we are rather than the group that we belong to, it should be okay. If someone speaks out I only want to focus on thier truth, and I hope they do the same for me.
