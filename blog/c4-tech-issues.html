      <!-- What is the issue -->
      Designing for accessibility in a nutshell, is designing your apps, websites etc. so that is accessible to users with physical limitations. When you are new to design, it's easy to not take accessessability into account, but it can effect the number of people that use your app or visit your site. To put it simply, you can create the most useful app, or the most beautiful website, but if it is difficult for people to navigate, they won't. <br>
      I take this issue to heart, because without surgery or corrective lenses I naturally have very limited visual capabilities.

        <!-- why is it an issue -->
    A good deal of people believe that designing for accessibility starts at the ground level. I agree with this approach. It's much easier to take steps to optimize whatever you are building along the way, rather than to go back once it is built and try to make changes. There are many ways to test how easily accessible your site or app is before you even launch it. It's good to put yourself in other people's shoes when you test everything.

     <p>
    A quick example of an easy way to design for accessibility - <br>
    Let's say you have just completed styling a website and it looks beautiful. You can test if it is clearly legible and accessible to those with vision impairments like color blindness etc. by running the site in gray scale. If during the the test you see that the text color is hard to read against your background color you know that you should adjust either the background or the text color to make it more distinct. You can go back, choose a color you like, run it in gray scale to double check, and if it is easily legible you have taken a step to optimize your site for the visually impaired. It's just that simple.    
    </p>
    
    <p>
   There are many tools that designers and programmers can use to improve the accessibility of their products, but it takes time to learn, and sometimes even the simplest solutions are not something that would naturally register. W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative is working to develop guidelines and provide resources to make it easier for everyone to incorporate these practices. 
   <br>	
   I continue to be amazed at how simple some of the solutions to poor accessibility are. I think that raising more awareness about how people with limitations use the web and other products would be a good way to move forward. It is essential to understand how people are using your products and services so that you can incorporate that into your design process.
