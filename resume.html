     <h2> PROFILE</h2> <br>


I am a resourceful and enthusiastic assistant who has produced consistently positive results for the 

leaders of two New York-based production companies with projects ranging from developing an HBO 

series to producing Broadway musicals.  I have also worked in front-office sales and office support for a 

comedy club.  I am looking apply my skills in an equally entrepreneurial and creative setting, but one with 

more growth potential and opportunity for professional and personal development.
